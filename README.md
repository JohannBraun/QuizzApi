# QuizzApi

This project was created as part of an online python learning course. 

This project was possible thanks to the help of the API from: https://opentdb.com/api.php

QuizzApi is a program that pulls ten random yes/no questions from the open trivia database API. 
You answer each question one after the other and a green, red background represents a correct, wrong answer. 
Your score is being tracked on the upper right corner. The game ends after you answered all ten questions. 

python concepts in this project:

- use of APIs
- classes
- inheritance
